                "intro": "Through art deco and fauvist inspiration, I wanted to evoke a feeling of joyful escapsism. The small step away from reality that these movements represent allow the viewer to experience sensorial immersion in a way that isn't possible with hyper-realistic images.", 
                "text01": "I sifted through these paintings to come up with a color palette that embodied the idea of dream, joy, and nature. I drew inspiration from the simple organic shapes and lines used in the Art Deco and Matisse paintings and combined them with the colors used to portray the wondrous atmosphere of an oasis.", 
                "text02": "To explore painting techniques and color combinations, I did a color study of Monet's 'Impression, Sunrise' and experimented with different ways of presenting bodies. ", 
                "nextSteps": "While this painting did achieve a level of dreaminess and wonder through the perspective and unexpected splash of blue in the center of the page, the color palette feels unfocussed, which is distracting. The landscape feels wide but not expansive. In order to do this I will experiment with a three-paneled approach to widen the scope of the painting, as well as limit my palette to complementary colors."

I drew inspiration from Peggy Gou's performance at her London Mixmag set and her song 'Starry Night' to experiment with making music a more visual, visceral experience. The photos below are stills from a recording of her performance.", 
                "intro": "At a live event, colorful lights often enhance the viewer's musical experience. I was inspired by the lights at Peggy Gou's set and tried to incorporate similar colors into my world. I started experimenting with environment configurations on Unity3D.", 
                "text01": "After deciding on the color palette for the environment, I started populating the 3D world with surreal imagery. My intention was to use realistic 3D models in an unrealistic setting, so that the viewer would be immersed by the familiarity of some of the imagery, but would want to explore because of their unusual context.", 
                "nextSteps": "This piece was exciting to work on and presents an immersive way of experiencing music. However, I used mostly camera and environment transitions to match specific transitions in the song, but next time I could animate more of the objects to the beat of the music."

The users took over 2 minutes to find and select a dish they already knew they wanted to eat. It was much faster to leave a review (8s), but this app needs to be equally as easy for the user to compare reviews to find a dish. It needs to be able to facilitate fast and efficient decision making."

I would be curious to conduct A/B testing on different sequences of interactions and pages. I would also like to combine a statistical A/B test with a more qualitative user test to get a more holitic idea of how a user is interacting with a given interface. It would also be interesting to conduct an A/B test on a more interactive interface, where a user has to make more complex decisions than just making a selection out of four options."

                "nextSteps": "While I think we got a good grasp of Shiru Cafe's customers and what they look for in an interface, they way we presented the mental models and personas made it difficult to understand at first glance how they differentiated from one another. Personas should be displayed at very distinct from each other, as to better understand all the different customer segments that might interact with the interface."

BABYFACE MEDIA is a music video collective started by a group of Brown University and RISD students (including me!). Our aim is to create playful and colorful visuals to accompany music. The goal of this project was to create an interactive single page website that is experimental and lighthearted. It needed to be able to showcase our videos, while giving the user a strong sense of BABYFACE's identity. The site can be found at babyface.media -- check it out!",
                "intro":"I first outlined the WHY Babyface’s website should exist, WHAT it should communicate about its brand, and also started thinking about HOW I could depart from traditional website styles to showcase Babyface’s work in a less traditional and more brutalist way.", 
                "text01":"After deciding to move forward with Idea #2, I experimented with a few different ways of navigating to and opening video on the site. The videos will be the most important element of this website, and should open in a way that allows the viewer to focus on the video without being distracted by the background.", 
                "text02":"After deciding on a design to move forward with, I started building the website using Vue.js. In order to increase interactivity and simulate a desktop space, I experimented with making the icons moveable. I had to make changes to the design to make it more intuitive, such as adding an “exit” button to exit the contact form and video.", 
                "nextSteps":"This website did a good job of showcasing BABYFACE's work in a more playful way, but was unintuitive to users who are not used to experimental website design. While it was formatted for mobile devices, the user loses the dektop design of the website, and becomes more difficult to use. The playfulness aspect hinders mobile usage. To improve this on mobile, the icons can open in a separate window so the original interface doesn't change too much and confuse the user."

I worked with UI/UX designers, creative technologists, software engineers, and client-facing product managers to bring this project to its completion.", 
                "intro": "The initial prompt for this internship was to create a project that addresses people's sense of self worth as a result of their use of AR filters on social media. After prototyping about 40 different ideas, we met with client who decided to take a different direction, and gave us a new prompt of showcasing the Tate and its visitors' identities to increase visitor engagement with the museum. I had 3 days to turn our entire project around, and worked with our mentors in the office to create three new concepts for our product, then saw it through to execution!", 
                "text01": "The final product, as shown below, was a data visualiser that showed engagement of the Tate Modern with its online visitors. In this process, I cleaned data collected by the Tate and Google Analytics, crafted a narrative out of it, designed prototypes for the visualizer, and coded physics-simulated prototypes on Processing. We worked with Holition's creative technologist and software engineers to build the final product.", 
                "nextSteps":"This product was one of the most engaging and fun projects I've been able to work on. I learnt everything from talking to high profile clients to creating physics simulations. The biggest takeaway I had from this project was to be quickly adaptable to the client needs. Also, to check in with the client as early as possible to make sure everyone is on the same page in terms of the project direction. While the Tate loved some of our initial ideas, the original prompt didn't resonate with them as strongly as we had hoped. Checking in with clients earlier in the process will save a lot of time and resources moving forward!"
